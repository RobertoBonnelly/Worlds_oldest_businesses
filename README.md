In this repository, there is a dataset (businesses.csv) that corresponds to a dataframe of very old businesses, the year they were founded, their foundation country, and the category of the business, which explains what kind of product the business produces. Also, there are other dataframes with information that can be useful when merge with the businesses.csv dataframe.

In the notebook, there are cells where the dataframes are manipulated in order to expand the information a single dataframe can give by doing merges according to certain information in each dataframe.
